# ValueAtRisk_AlphaVantage_CryptoPortfolio
 VaR model for crypto asset portfolio. I am making this model much more in depth and user friendly than my last. Adding a few new features as well.

 ## Install
 To install the package use:
 ```shell
 pip install alpha_vantage
 ```
 Or install with pandas support, simply install pandas too:
 ```shell
 pip install alpha_vantage, pandas
 ```

 If you want to install from source, then use:
 ```shell
 git clone https://github.com/Lukeshirleyx/ValueAtRisk_AlphaVantage_CryptoPortfolio
 pip install -e alpha_vantage
 ```
